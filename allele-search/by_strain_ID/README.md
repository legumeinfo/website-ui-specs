# Allele search query by Strain ID - find variants around a gene or in a region for specified strains, within a specified variant collection 

This is the initial/draft requirements doc for the SoyBase allele search by strain, to be implemented on the respective Jekyll web sites. This search component should enable search of specified variant collections (VCF files) in the vicinity of a specified gene or within a specified region for specified strains. 
Note that the specification is for SoyBase first, partly because many VCF files are available for soybean. The specification and implementation may be generalized later for use with other species at LIS and PeanutBase.

## Specification version
Version: 0.2.0

<details>

 The first implementation will probably be done in in-page javascript rather than in a web component, since the GraphQL schema is not yet described for fasta-api.

## Input
A variant collection, as a VCF file
