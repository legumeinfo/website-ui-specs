# GRIN trait data query and explorer - to search or explorer the GRIN trait data 

This is the requirements doc for the SoyBase GRIN data explorer. This component should be enable users to select one or more traits from a selected "traitClass" or "traitName". For the users to learn more info about the traits, the "traitDescription" from the traits-Genus.json file, should be available to view.

## Specification version
Version: 0.1

<details>
This specification was completed in late December 2024 and was initally designed for a single species. 
Currently all 
</details>

## Input
  - Limited search to choosen GRIN accessions
    - Text box for choosen GRIN accessions
    - Same input as below
  - Search all GRIN accessions
    - Select at least one trait
    - Select value of trait
      - Use a range slider if the trait value is digital (numerical)
      - Use a multi select dropdown if the trait value is a character (alphabetical)

![GRIN Explorer SELECTED accessions](https://github.com/legumeinfo/website-ui-specs/blob/GRIN-data-explorer/grin-data-explorer/GRIN_Explorer_selected_acessions.png "Search selected accessions")

## Output

The output will be in a tabular layout, with the following content in each GRIN accession anchored row:
  - GRIN accession (PI ##; example: PI 567571)
  - traitName selected with values assiocated with the PI #
  - traitName selected with values assiocated with the PI #
  - traitName selected with values assiocated with the PI #
    - ? Not sure if we should limit the number of columns ?

## Implementation notes

  - The data behind this tool comes from two files: traits-'Genus'.json and observations-'Genus'.json
    - (example: traits-Glycine.json and observations-Glycine.json).
      
  - The best way to link the two files is by using the "DbId" variable
    - In the traits-'Genus'.json this variable is called "traitDbId" (Example: "traitDbId": "51009")
    - In the observations-'Genus'.json this variable is called "observationVariableDbId" (Example: "observationVariableDbId": "51009")

  - Within traits-'Genus'.json file the values need for this spec are:
    - traitClass
    - traitName
    - traitDescription
    - traitDbId

  - Within observations-'Genus'.json file the values need for this spec are:
    - observationVariableDbId
    - germplasmName
    - observationVariableName
    - value
